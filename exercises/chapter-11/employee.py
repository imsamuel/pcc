"""11-3. Employee: 
Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take in a first 
name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. 
Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the annual salary by 
default but also accepts a different raise amount. Write a test case for 
Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_ default_raise() and 
test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create a 
new employee instance in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure 
both tests pass."""
