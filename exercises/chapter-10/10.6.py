10-6. Addition: 
One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people 
provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an int, 
youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them 
together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if either input value is not 
a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your program by entering two 
numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.

    print(num1 + num2)
