"""
5-1. Conditional Tests: 
Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test 
and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look 
something like this:

car = 'subaru' 
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.") 
print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.") 
print(car == 'audi')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line 
evaluates to True or False. 

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another
5 tests evaluate to False.
