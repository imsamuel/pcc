"""
9-4. Number Served: 
Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166). Add an attribute called 
number_served with a default value of 0. Create an instance called restaurant 
from this class . Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and 
then change this value and print it again. Add a method called set_number_served() 
that lets you set the number of customers that have been served. Call this 
method with a new number and print the value again. Add a method called 
increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers 
whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number you like that could 
represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.
