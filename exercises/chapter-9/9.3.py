9-3. Users: 
Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and 
last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically 
stored in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a 
summary of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that 
prints a personalized greeting to the user. Create several instances 
representing different users, and call both methods for each user.
